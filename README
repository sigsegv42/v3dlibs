New in version 0.0.9 (xx-xx-08)

libv3dimage
Improvements in image library. More extensive format support for image reading along with new support for writing images. Both reading and writing of images in JPEG, TGA, BMP, PNG formats is now supported (though not in all possible format variants). 

libhookah
The backend driver is now separate from the core Hookah library. A new event-driven driver using FLTK has been added. The original SDL driver has been moved out of the base library. Each driver has its own additional library. Clients must now provide the window dimensions at window creation time.

libv3dtypes
There is a new Bound2D data type for specifying 2D bounding volumes.

libv3dgui
The input event adapter now allows for connecting multiple event listeners to a single adapter.

libv3dcommand
The event info object now supports an optional data parameter to be associated with the event.


New in version 0.0.8 (02-25-08)
Added separate abstract input library, removed command library dependency from hookah and input libraries. Added support for mouse input. Lots of small bugfixes and code cleanups.


New in version 0.0.7 (12-12-07)
More API documentation, code cleanups, reorganizations.

libv3daudio
New library. Audio support was moved from the hookah library into its own separate library.

libv3dcommand
The command / event / binding system is rewritten. Command tables have been removed and command handlers are now provided using the boost signal library. Support for a command parameter string has also been added.

libv3dfont
New library. Font support was moved from the hookah library into its own separate library. The font system has also been completely rewritten to use the FreeType2 library for cross-platform loading of truetype fonts.

libv3dimage
New library. Image support was moved from the hookah library into its own separate library. PNG loading bugfixes.

libhookah
Moved audio, image, font support to their own libraries. Improved texture support for 8-bit textures. The boost signal library is now used for the game loop callbacks.
